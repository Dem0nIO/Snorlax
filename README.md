Check pokemons stats. [Available through Xposed repository](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.icecream.snorlax)  
  
This module acts as a [man in the middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) on PokÃ©mon Go's communications with the server, and allows us to add extra features to the game.

Features:
- Prevent PokemonGo from detecting GPS is being spoofed (similar to Mock Mock Locations)
- Show pokemon stats on the inventory
- Show pokemon stats as a system notification when you encounter them: IV's, HP, CP, level, moves, catch probability
- Show catch results: Success, missed, flee, etc.

Pokemon stats custom formats:
- Nickname
  - %NICK% : Shows pokemon full name. %NICK% -> Snorlax
  - %NICK.#% : Trims pokemon name by #. %NICK.3% -> Sno
- Level
  - %LVL% : Shows pokemon level with one decimal. %LVL% -> 2.5
  - %LVL.#% : Round up and trims pokemon level by # decimals. %LVL.0% -> 3. %LVL.2% -> 2.50
  - %LVLP% : Same as %LVL% but add leading zeros. %LVLP% -> 02.5
  - %LVLP.#% : Same as %LVL.#% but add leading zeros. %LVLP.0% -> 03. %LVLP.2% -> 02.50
- Iv
  - %IV% : Shows pokemon iv with one decimal. %IV% -> 6.7
  - %IV.#% : Round up and trims pokemon iv by # decimals. %IV.0% -> 7. %IV.2% -> 6.67
  - %IVP% : Same as %IV% but add leading zeros. %IVP% -> 006.7
  - %IVP.#% : Same as %IV.#% but add leading zeros. %IVP.0% -> 007. %IVP.2% -> 006.67
- Attack
  - %ATT% : Shows pokemon attack. %ATT% -> 1
  - %ATTP% : Shows pokemon attack with leading zero. %ATTP% -> 01
  - %ATTH% : Shows pokemon attack with hexadecimal format. %ATTH% (15) -> F
- Defense
  - %DEF% : Shows pokemon defense. %DEF% -> 1
  - %DEFP% : Shows pokemon defense with leading zero. %DEFP% -> 01
  - %DEFH% : Shows pokemon defense with hexadecimal format. %DEFH% (15) -> F
- Stamina
  - %STA% : Shows pokemon stamina. %STA% -> 1
  - %STAP% : Shows pokemon stamina with leading zero. %STAP% -> 01
  - %STAH% : Shows pokemon stamina with hexadecimal format. %STAH% (15) -> F

Note: Snorlax wont format other that the above commands. This means that you could add a '%' next to the Iv like this: %IV%% -> 6.7%
